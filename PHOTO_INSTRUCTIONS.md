# ðŸ“¸ How to Add Your Profile Photo

## Steps to add your photo:

1. **Save your photo** as `profile-photo.jpg` in the `public` folder
   - Navigate to: `maryam-portfolio/public/`
   - Save your photo with the exact name: `profile-photo.jpg`

2. **Photo requirements:**
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Recommended size: 400x400 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio works best)
   - File size: Under 2MB for faster loading

3. **Alternative names supported:**
   - `profile-photo.jpg`
   - `profile-photo.png`
   - `profile-photo.webp`

## What I've already done:

âœ… Updated the Hero component to display your photo
âœ… Added CSS styling with hover effects
âœ… Added fallback to placeholder if photo doesn't load
âœ… Made it responsive for mobile devices

## After adding your photo:

1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Your photo will appear in the hero section with a nice circular frame
3. The photo will have a subtle floating animation and hover effects

## Troubleshooting:

- If photo doesn't appear, check the file name matches exactly: `profile-photo.jpg`
- Make sure the photo is in the `public` folder, not `src`
- Try refreshing the browser (Ctrl+F5)
